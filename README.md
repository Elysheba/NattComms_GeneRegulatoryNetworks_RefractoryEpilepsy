# NattComms_RCode

This GitHub repo contains all the code used to analyse the data of the Nature Communications paper "Identification of gene regulatory networks affected across drug-resistant epilepsies" (Fran√ßois, Romagnolo et al. (2024)).

- Scripts S01.. detail the module construction and annotation by pathology
- Scripts S02.. show the bootstrapping procedure to assess module robustness
- Scripts S03.. calculate the conservation of gene coexpression in other epilepsy cohorts and healthy control tissue
- Scripts S04.. describe the calculation of differential coexpression
- Script S05 shows how the epilepsy regulomes were constructed
- Script S06 performs PCA/DAPC across the cohorts
- source_functions.R presents some additional functions required to run the scripts
